## Problem Statement
- Make a React application
- On loading, of the page, make an API request to fetch all users. ( LIST USERS API Endpoint)( https://reqres.in/)
- Store all the data in the redux store â€¢ get the total number of users from the response and make those many buttons on the web page ( do not hard code the number, it has to come from the API)
- for example: [ 1 ] , [ 2 ], [ 3 ], [ 4 ], [ 5 ].... [ n ] 
- on clicking the button retrieve that users data only using [ SINGLE USER API Endpoint ) ( do not use data from the previous API call )( https://reqres.in/) 
- do not add event listeners to each button 
- after retrieving show the response, create a card and fill info on the page, only one user card will be shown at a time. ( when the page loads for the first time, don't show a card, you may keep a placeholder card or text asking the user to click on any button )
